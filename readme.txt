Welcome user! This is basically a Mini Assistant. It is kinda a tiny subset of Siri, Alexa, ... 
Please ensure to have a proper Internet Connection. 
Installation is just a One-Time Process. After that, your assistant will helps you in performing your tasks.


I assume that Python is installed in your system and you know how to run a python file.
In case you don't know: i request you to visit "https://www.python.org/downloads/", select your OS and download it accordingly.

Step 1: Unzip (extract) all the files and Open the folder where you extracted the zipped file (in case if it is zipped).
Step 2: Open "installation.txt". Follow all the steps, and then come back here.
Step 3: As you are now reading Step 3, so i assume that step 2 is completed. Now open "Assistant.py" (either with Python or you can also use your terminal, IDE's, etc).
A restart is Optional.


* I HOPE YOUR ASSISTANT IS RUNNING NOW *
In case, it's not. I request you to take help from google. This Project is better compatible with Python 3.9.6 version and all the modules used is given in "requirements.txt" along with their specific versions.
Although, it's always recommended to use latest versions. But in case whenever you are accessing this project, may be because of some unexpected thing, it may not be run properly in latest versions. So, i request you try with all the versions stated above.

Now, let's be Optimistic and there is a high chance it will not create problem.

Now,

If you run this Assistant for the first time, it will ask you for your music directory[expect only .mp3 files in that directory] (just a one time process). When you let your assistant know about your music directory, your assistant will play musics for you whenever you want.
In case if you do not know how to locate your music directory take help from google. When you provide your music directory location to your assistant, it will automatically create a '0000_user_data.txt' file in the same directory. So, if you want to change music directory location, either delete this '0000_user_data.txt' file or open it and edit its content with your new music directory location (so that assistant will look into this for playing music).
